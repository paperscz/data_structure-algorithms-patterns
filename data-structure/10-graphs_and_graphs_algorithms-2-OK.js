/**
 * Graphs and graphs algorithms
 *
 * A graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of edges.
 *
 * Example : Think of a map of a US state. Each
 *              town is connected with other towns via some type of road. A map is a type of graph
 *              where each town is a vertex, and a road that connects two towns is an edge. Edges are
 *              defined as a pair (v1, v2), where v1 and v2 are two vertices in a graph.
 *
 * A vertex can also have a weight, which is sometimes called a cost.
 *
 * A graph whose pairs are ordered is called a directed graph, or just a digraph.
 *
 * When pairs are ordered in a directed graph, an arrow is drawn from one pair to another pair.
 *
 * Directed graphs indicate the flow direction from vertex to vertex.
 *
 * If a graph is not ordered, it is called an unordered graph, or just a graph.
 *
 * A path is a sequence of vertices in a graph such that all vertices in the path are connected
 * by edges. The length of a path is the number of edges from the first vertex in the path
 * to the last vertex. A path can also consist of a vertex to itself, which is called a loop.
 * Loops have a length of 0.
 *
 * A cycle is a path with at least one edge whose first and last vertices are the same.
 *
 * A simple cycle is one with no repeated edges or vertices for both directed and undirected graphs.
 *
 * Paths that repeat other vertices besides the first and last vertices are called general cycles.
 *
 * Two vertices are considered strongly connected if there is a path from the first vertex to
 * the second vertex, and vice versa.
 *
 * If the graph is a directed graph, and all its vertices are strongly connected, then the directed graph
 * is considered strongly connected.

/**

 * the first vertex and then moving down to the layers farthest away from the starting vertex.
 * 
 * The algorithm for breadth-first search uses a queue abstraction instead of an array
 * abstraction for storing visited vertices. The algorithm works as follows:
 * 
    1. Find an unvisited vertex that is adjacent to the current vertex, add it to the list of
        visited vertices, and add it to the queue.

    2. Take the next vertex, v, from the graph and add it to the list of visited vertices.

    3. Add all unmarked vertices that are are adjacent to v and add them to the queue.

        Finding the Shortest Path

        One of the most common operations performed on graphs is finding the shortest path
        from one vertex to another. 
        
        Consider the following example: for vacation, you are going
        to travel to 10 major-league cities to watch baseball games over a two-week period. You
        want to minimize the number of miles you have to drive to visit all 10 cities using a
        shortest-path algorithm. 
        
        Another shortest-path problem involves creating a network of
        computers, where the cost could be the time to transmit data between two computers
        or the cost of establishing and maintaining the connection. A shortest-path algorithm
        can determine the most effective way to build the network.
